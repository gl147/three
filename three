Lesson three

Gitignore, .gitkeep, git branch, git merge

Gitignore - is a file that prevent of commiting garbage files and folders. For exapmle .DS_Store at mac.
It is hidden file, so its name has to begin with dot ".gitignore"
Usually .gitignore has same structure at each project, but we also can change it and add some extra files and folders to be ignored

Git does not see folders, if they are emty. .gitkeep file is used to make folder visible for git

We can create branches of the project, the first branch is main. then we can create a copy of project and make changes on it, meanwhile main branch stay safe with the same content

gir branch [branchName] - creates new branch of current project.

git branch - displays all available branches of a project 

current active branch of a project is called HEAD

git checkout [branchName] - change HEAD to pointed branch

same result:

git switch [branchName]

git -m [oldBranchName] [newBranchName] - renames branches

git -m [newBranchName] - renames HEAD branch to newBranchName

git merge [branchName] - add all changes that was made at branch branchName to HEAD branch, and add all commits from branchName to HEAD
