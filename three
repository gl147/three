Lesson three

Gitignore, .gitkeep, git branch, git merge

Gitignore - is a file that prevent of commiting garbage files and folders. For exapmle .DS_Store at mac.
It is hiden file, so its name has to begin with dot ".gitignore"
Usually .gitignore has same structure at each project, but we also can change it and add some extra files and folders to be ignored

Git do not see folders, if they are emty. .gitkeep file is used to make folder visible for git
